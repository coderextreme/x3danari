I using this project as an exploration of animating Humanoid Animation models written to follow the x3d.py (x3d) python module.  The models aren't written in USD or glTF, they are written in python.  This is a fairly immature project currently, and I don't have many examples yet.  Skinned models with indexed face sets are processed with skinned_x3d_renderer.py and non-skinned HAnim geometry (a few geometric shapes) are processed by interactive_x3_renderer.py.  Check out the main in those renderers to handle different models.
